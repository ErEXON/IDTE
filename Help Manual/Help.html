<h4>Request Features</h4>
<p>Open a new ticket in the <b>Request feature</b> section.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee it will be added however; what is a great feature for one person might be a big nuisance for another, or it simply is too difficult or time consuming to add it in. They are hints as to what are the most wished-for additions or modifications to the software, and they will be considered on the basis of urgency, popularity, available developer time and technical feasibility</p>

<h4>Report Bugs</h4>
<p>Open a new ticket in the <b>Bug report</b> section.</p>
<p>If you find that IDTE isn't working correctly or plain crashing, you probably encountered a bug. First check if you have the latest version, each release IDTE gets improved and bugs get fixed (unfortunately, sometimes added as well so always tread careful when updating).Check the forums: maybe other users noticed it as well and found a fix or are in discussion.</p>
<p>Search for it and if it's not there, you can add it and help the developers find and fix it.</p>

<div id="Migration" class="rohitink-tabs-pane">
<h2>Migration to Jupiter v2.0</h2>


<p>In V2.0 we have done huge changes to both backend and fronted. these changes were performance improvements, new features, bug fixes, new design in Masterkey Framework and a new page composer with huge functionality.</p>

<p>I would like to take the time to appreciate for all your patience until I deliver this version. I have some notes and steps for your on how to migrate to V2.0</p>

<p>Please note that depending to number of your pages this migration may take from 10 min to 2 hours. so I suggest you to enable maintenance mode to avoid visitors see the site while you are fixing some issues.</p>

<p>We have changed the whole page composer with the newest version of Visual composer, it took a lot of effort to migrate our old page composer to new one as we had to do this process smoothly and carefully to avoid any issues that might happen to current customers. Good news is that we have migrated successfully without compromising anything and now its ready to use. </p>

<h5>Why we have moved to new version : </h5>

<ol>
<li>Its coded with Backbone.js a library which adds speed to your process. </li>
<li>more easier to control, its drag and drop feature improved.</li>
<li>Rows have been introduced so you can have nested columns, columns into page section, tabs and accordions into columns and many more stuff that if you worked for a long with old one you will see the big change and possibility that you can achieve now.</li>
<li>Many small features such as new media uploader for gallery shortcode that I don't want to point out all of them here.</li>
</ol>

<h5>What will happen to our contents that we built them with old page composer?</h5>

<p>Since in new page composer shortcodes can not be placed in visual canvas, they all must be placed inside a row or page section shortcode.
In new page composer none of the elements are built-in columns. but This process has been automated. if you visit a page that built with old page composer you will face with a button that ask you to convert the page elements to new one. now here we have 2 steps :</p>

<ul>
<li> If you did not use page section shortcode in this page, here we go click on convert and thats it. check everything and delete empty text blocks that you may find between short codes (this is normal to see empty text blocks). Preview page and fix any column issue that you find is not converted correctly.</li>
<li>If you have used page section you should follow below steps :</li>
<ul>

<ol>
<li>Once you arrive to the page click classic mode to switch to classic editor.</li>
<li>search for page section shortcode and insert vc_column shortcode right inside of it as below :</li>

[rohitink_page_section][vc_column width="1/" el_position="first"]     your short codes inside this page section stays here     [/rohitink_page_section][/vc_column]

<li>Once you have done with this process click on Page Composer mode and hit the button that asks you to convert the content.</li>
<li>As the content is converted visit back the classic editor and find the page sections once again and remove [vc_row][vc_column width="1/2" el_position="first"] from where [rohitink_page_section] shortcode starts.</li>
<li>Also remove the closing shortcode tags of [/vc_column][/vc_row] wherever you find [/rohitink_page_section]</li>
<li>you will need to set the columns inside page section manually(in other places this will be converted automatically).</li>

</ol>

<h5>Tabs & Accordions</h5>

<p>Since Tabs and accordions coding in page composer and front-end has been changed in v2+, you will need to clone tabs or accordions using clone icon (in page composer visual mode) and delete the old one. This action will trigger the nesessary codes and build up the shortcode and other front-end needed unique IDs.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Thats all about it. if you need our assistance or feel you can not convert a page yourself please open a thread and leave your WP access. Our staff will work more hours this week to cover support issues more faster to make this migration smoother for everyone.</p>


<p>For anyone who have purchased the v2+ will no longer need to follow above steps and you can enjoy our new dummy data(that converted). We have updated documentation => Page Composer section to explain the new added sections in detail. We have updated Page Template section in documentation as well so you can use them with new page composer.</p>

<p>For any quick question I will try my best to back to you in comments section throughout the day.</p>
